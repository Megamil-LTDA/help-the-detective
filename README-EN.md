# 🕵️ Help the Detective

A detective game developed for the [Tiny Game Jam (12/25)](https://itch.io/jam/tiny-game-jam-12-25).

## 📖 About the Project

**Help the Detective** is a deduction game where you take on the role of a detective at the beginning of your career, trying to enter a highly restricted field of private investigation. Before being accepted, you must solve a series of old, unsolved cases where the evidence seems to point to an obvious truth — but is wrong.

This is a special project created in **partnership between father and son**:
- **Eduardo dos Santos** - Software Developer
- **Eduardo dos Santos Jr.** (11 years old) - Designer and Artist

### 🎂 A Special Date

The project was submitted on **December 28th**, a date that coincides with Eduardo's (father) birthday, making this project even more meaningful. Being able to create something side by side with my son and finish it on this date is already a reward in itself.
